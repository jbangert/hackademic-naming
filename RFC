A DNS based namespace for hacker research

The Dartmouth Scooby Crew 
Introduction
================================================================================

Over the last years, the volume of hacker research has grown
immensely, yet we still rely on ad-hoc methods to archive and index
our work, such as archives maintained by the conferences, private
collections and en-vogue cloud services like YouTube. Because access
to these collections is non-uniform (every conference has a slightly
different system, furthermore e.g. the DEFCON website looks different
every year). Finding the particular version of a paper published in a
smaller hacker conference (e.g. PXE) or journal will be nontrivial.

We believe that one of the key obstacles to proper archival is the
lack of a uniform namespace. \todo{Rant about namespaces?}.

Academia has long argued for the benefits of proper naming (and by
extension, archival), however the implemented naming scheme (journal
name, author name, title), which places the burden of archival both on
librarians dedicated to this purpose and on the journal publishers,
translates poorly to the hacker community and its rapidly evolving,
rather volatile publication venues. As the same scalability issues are
beginning to affect traditional academic publishing, other solutions
like DOI have evolved, however they are neither widely used nor
practical. \todo{Parallel between current academic archival and ad-hoc
hackers, yet without the librarians. Librarians are expensive}

Therefore, we propose our namespace for hacker research based on the
domain name system (RFC XXX). DNS allows names to be hierarchical,
delegated and human-readable, properties that while originally
intended to name Internet hosts are useful for naming research works.
Delegation allows the system to continue functioning without the
attention (or bias) of a central authority, whereas human-readable and
writable names are a must for practical use.

Details =======

 The Hacker Name Space (HNS, pronounced Phrackademic) can
be any hosted in any zone of the global DNS, although the authors will
intend to use spargelze.it and weirdmachin.es as canonical root
domains. For brevity, all other domain names in the text will be
relative to this root (i.e. foo. actually refers to
foo.weirdmachin.es.) and terms from RFC XXXX will be used.

We define a multi-layered hierarchy to classify publications. The top
layer of the hierarchy specifies the mode of publication (e.g. paper,
conference), the next layer the particular venue(e.g. Phrack, CCC),
with one or more layers specifying the particular instance of that
venue (e.g. 1st Confidence and 2nd Confidence in 20xx). The last layer
of the hierarchy is the particular paper or talk. # Each paper or talk
contains sub-records describing various attributes of the talk( #as
described below) and the layers of the hierarchy above that contain
both sub-# zones and leaf n

Root
====
The HNS root contains subzones for various venues of publication
Name         Aliases       Intended use
conference.  con., c.      Conferences and similar venues:
      Each conference must be encoded in a subzone of the format
      name.c, e.g. def.con., ccc.con, toor.con. The next layer in the
      hierarchy must specify the year the conference occured (e.g.
      2012.def.con), with an optional additional layer to further
      specify a particular instance of a conference (i.e.
      seattle.2011.toor.con)


journal.     j.            Journals, with some process of review and a public submission process (e.g. no company/personal blogs or marketing outlets). 

             Each journal must use a consistent way to label its
             issues, such as (69.phrack.org) using as many layers as
             deemed appropriate by that journal or its archivers.

misc.        m.            Other venues of publication. A forthcoming informal process will be used to create subzones(e.g. twitter. ).

blog.        b.            Possible subzones for blogs and other non-reviewed web versions.
Venue
=====
Each edition of a particular venue receives a zone according to the above naming scheme (e.g. 2013.pxe.con.), which should be delegated to another archivist (typically, the conference organizer). This archivist assigns arbitrary, but immutable subzone names for each publication in this venue (i.e. elf-metadata.2012.def.con), the contents of which is described below.

Each venue may contain the following descriptive sub-records
Name         Type         Description and Example
x_date       TXT          Date range (x_date.2012.def.con: dd.mm.2012--dd.mm.2012)
x_www        TXT          Website (x_www.2013.confidence.con: 2013.confidence.org.pl)
x_www         A            Redirect to the above, served from redir.weirdmachin.es ?  TBD
x_archivist  TXT          Email address of the person who created this archive 
                        (x_archive.2015.langsec.con: pastor@phrack.org)


All subzones beginning with x_ are reserved for conference metadata, as opposed to conference entries.

Author records
==============
Initially, every paper zone will contain subzones for its author records, with the format described below. In order to allow identity management of authors (and reduce the size of the HNS), any author can receive a subzone xxxxx.person. (xxxxx.p.) where xxxxx is a SHA-2 hash of the authors public key. With the corresponding private key, the author will be able to update the descriptive records (marked with a D below) in his zone:

Name       Type  Description
website.   TXT   URL of the authors website (D)
.          A     Either under the authors control or a redirect to the contents of website.     (D)
mail.      TXT   The authors email(D)
twitter.   TXT   The authors twitter handle(D)
name.      TXT   The authors preferred handle or name
handle.    TXT   A version of the above containing only the characters allowed in RFC 1035

For convenience, the maintainers of the HNS will provide a handle. namespace which contains human readable DNAME records.
Alternative query means:
========================
As the Quux suggested, DNS is not a great means to encode a graph database, but it has scalability and interoperability benefits. In the future, it would be interesting to explore integration of another query mechanism (say, LDAP).
